## About Me
I'm a recent graduate in Engineering Mathematics from the University of Bristol with a strong interest in quantitative finance and risk management. I have hands-on experience in developing various quantitative models, conducting data analysis, and optimising models for clients needs.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, R, SQL, C
- **Financial Analysis**: Risk Management, Portfolio Optimisation, Quantitative Analysis
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Excel

## Projects
### [Enhanced KMV Model](https://github.com/MohitVellore/Enhanced-KMV-model) - In progress
This project extends the traditional KMV credit risk model by incorporating modern techniques to improve the prediction of future asset values and the estimation of default probabilities. Key enhancements include:
- Monte Carlo Simulations: Used to simulate future asset value paths under various market conditions, providing a comprehensive view of potential future scenarios.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Implemented to predict future asset values more accurately, leveraging historical data and advanced statistical methods.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Applied to classify firms into default and non-default categories based on financial metrics and market conditions, improving the accuracy of the Distance to Default (DD) calculations.
- Ensemble Methods: Utilized to enhance the robustness of the Probability of Default (PD) predictions, combining multiple models to mitigate the risk of individual model biases and improve overall performance.

## Experience
### [Technical Research Paper - ‚ÄúMathematical Modelling of the Peloton‚Äù](https://github.com/MohitVellore/Technical-Research-Paper-/tree/main)
- Constructed an agent-based model to analyse peloton dynamics in professional road cycling, optimising rider performance for given scenarios.
- Employed differential game theory, discrete physiological modelling, and parallel/high-performance computing.

### Albourne Partners ‚Äì Risk Advisory Analyst (Summer Intern)
- Conducted in-depth research on various topics, delivering both quantitative and qualitative findings to senior internal and external stakeholders.
- Developed models using statistical techniques, including Monte Carlo simulations and Markov chains.
- Optimized models to meet clients' needs and automated a robust methodology to generate private market forecasts.

### London Institute of Banking and Finance ‚Äì Student Investor Lead Analyst
- Managed a virtual investment portfolio, achieving top 0.2% global ranking.

## Certifications
- Financial Risk Manager (FRM) - In progress
- J.P. Morgan Virtual Experience
- Future IM/PACT Virtual Experience

## Interests
- UFC, MMA, Golf, Cycling, Powerlifting
