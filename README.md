## Projects
### [UFC Fight Forecast: Predicting Winners, Methods, and Rounds](https://github.com/MohitVellore/UFC-Fight-Forecast-Predicting-Winners-Methods-and-Rounds-.git) - Ongoing
The UFC Fight Predictor project aims to analyse UFC fight statistics and video footage to make better informed decisions for matches and betting predictions. The predictions will include the fight winner, method of victory, round, and real-time analysis during fights. This project will be developed through several iterations, each adding more functionality and improving accuracy. Key activities include:
- Implement web scraping scripts to collect and preprocess data on fighters involved in upcoming UFC bouts.
- Develop machine learning models to predict fight outcomes, including the winner, method of victory, and round.
- Integrate computer vision techniques to analyze fight footage for deriving custom statistics, focusing initially on boxing, then expanding to clinch, submissions, and real-time fight analysis.
- Enhance predictions with real-time data visualization and advanced combo analysis.

**In collaboration with Lewis Newnham**
